			<p>
				Stock trading involves buying and selling stocks frequently in an
				attempt to time the market. The goal of stock traders is to capitalize
				on short-term market events to sell stocks for a profit, or buy stocks
				at a low. Some stock traders are day traders, which means they buy and
				sell several times throughout the day.

				<p>
					The term “equity” refers to fairness and justice and is distinguished
					from equality: Whereas equality means providing the same to all,
					equity means recognizing that we do not all start from the same place
					and must acknowledge and make adjustments to imbalances.
